# mine-sweeper
Mine Sweeper game implementation with API.

There's a bot I wrote which attempts to solve minesweeper puzzles as well as a basic bot which chooses moves at random.
Included in this repository is also a framework which tests a bot across many random puzzles and assesses its performance.

You can try to write your own bot and test its performance, see how it compares to mine :)
